# Archived File: Summary.tsx.bak

## Original Location
`/client/src/pages/Summary.tsx.bak`

## Date Archived
2025-04-30

## Reason for Archiving
This file has been archived as part of the transition from "client/ally" terminology to "patient/caregiver" terminology. It is a backup version of the Summary.tsx file that contained the old terminology.

## Dependencies
This file likely depends on:
- Client, Ally types from "@shared/schema"

## API Endpoints
This file likely uses API endpoints with `/clients/` which have been replaced with `/patients/` in the new implementation.

## Notes
This backup file contains the original implementation of the Summary page using the client/ally terminology. The main Summary.tsx file has already been updated to use patient/caregiver terminology, though there are still some references to "ally" in the code that need to be updated to "caregiver".
