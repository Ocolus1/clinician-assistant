# Archived File: ClientForm.tsx

## Original Location
`/client/src/components/onboarding/ClientForm.tsx`

## Date Archived
2025-04-29

## Reason for Archiving
This file has been archived as part of the transition from "client/ally" terminology to "patient/caregiver" terminology. It has been replaced by `PatientForm.tsx`.

## API Endpoints
This file likely used API endpoints with `/clients/` which have been replaced with `/patients/` in the new implementation.

## Notes
This component was responsible for handling the client onboarding process, including form submission and validation. If you need to restore this file, make sure to update any references to "client" to "patient" in the new system.
