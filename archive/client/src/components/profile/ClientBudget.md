# Archived File: ClientBudget.tsx

## Original Location
`/client/src/components/profile/ClientBudget.tsx`

## Date Archived
2025-04-29

## Reason for Archiving
This file has been archived as part of the transition from "client/ally" terminology to "patient/caregiver" terminology. It has been replaced by `PatientBudget.tsx`.

## Dependencies
This file was dependent on several components and types:
- BudgetCardGrid from '../budget/BudgetCardGrid'
- BudgetSettings, BudgetItem, BudgetItemCatalog types from "@shared/schema"

## Notes
This component was responsible for displaying and managing budget information for clients, including:
- Displaying budget settings
- Showing budget items in both card and table views
- Calculating total budget and remaining funds
- Providing interfaces for adding, editing, and deleting budget items

If you need to restore this file, make sure to also update any references to "client" to "patient" in the new system.
