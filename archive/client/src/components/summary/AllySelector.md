# Archived File: AllySelector.tsx

## Original Location
`/client/src/components/summary/AllySelector.tsx`

## Date Archived
2025-04-30

## Reason for Archiving
This file has been archived as part of the transition from "client/ally" terminology to "patient/caregiver" terminology. It should be replaced by a `CaregiverSelector.tsx` component.

## Usage
This component was used in:
- PrintSummary.tsx

## Notes
This component was responsible for selecting allies (now called caregivers) in the summary view. If you need to restore this file, make sure to update any references to "ally" to "caregiver" in the new system.
