# Clinician Assistant Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
The Clinician Assistant is an AI-powered natural language interface that allows clinicians to query the clinical database using everyday language. The system translates natural language questions into SQL queries, executes them against the database, and presents the results in a conversational format.

## Architecture
The implementation follows a four-phase approach:

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- ✓ Set up OpenAI API integration
- ✓ Create database connection for LLM access (read-only)
- ✓ Implement basic UI components (chat interface, message display)
- ✓ Design conversation storage schema

### Phase 2: Core LLM Integration
- ✓ Implement query processing pipeline
- ✓ Set up LangChain for conversation context management
- ✓ Create prompt engineering for SQL generation
- ✓ Implement SQL safety measures and query validation
- ✓ Add error handling for failed queries

### Phase 3: Enhanced UI and UX
- ✓ Create dashboard tile for navigation
- ✓ Implement dedicated page for assistant interface
- [ ] Add conversation management (save, load, name conversations)
- [ ] Create settings panel for configuration
- [ ] Add visual indicators for query status
- [ ] Create data visualization for query results

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Add user feedback mechanism
- [ ] Create automated tests for common queries
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security audit and enhancement

## Data Flow
1. User enters a natural language query
2. LLM interprets the query and converts to SQL
3. System validates SQL for safety and executability
4. Database executes the query and returns results
5. LLM summarizes the results in natural language
6. Conversation history is updated with the exchange

## Key Components

### Frontend
- **ChatInterface**: Main component for user interaction
- **MessageBubble**: Displays individual messages
- **ConversationSelector**: Manages multiple conversations
- **AssistantSettings**: Configuration panel

### Backend
- **clinicianAssistantService**: Main service orchestrating assistant functionality
- **conversationService**: Manages conversation state and persistence
- **sqlQueryGenerator**: Converts natural language to SQL
- **langchainService**: Handles LLM interaction and context management
- **knowledgeService**: Provides domain-specific knowledge

## Security Considerations
- Implement read-only database access for LLM
- Add query validation to prevent SQL injection
- Create allowlist/blocklist for sensitive tables
- Implement rate limiting
- Add proper logging for all queries
