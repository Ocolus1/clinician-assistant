# Agent Tools Expansion

## Overview

This document details the expansion of the ReactAgentService's capabilities through the addition of new tools that enable the agent to answer a broader range of common questions. These enhancements allow the clinician assistant to provide more comprehensive responses about patient care, session tracking, report generation, and budget management.

## New Tool Categories

### Session Tracking Tools

These tools help clinicians monitor patient session attendance and history:

- **get_patient_sessions**
  - Retrieves detailed session information for a specific patient
  - Supports optional date filtering (e.g., "this month", "last 3 weeks")
  - Provides monthly statistics and recent session details
  - Example: `get_patient_sessions("John Smith", "last 2 months")`

- **find_missed_sessions**
  - Identifies patients who missed or canceled their sessions
  - Groups results by patient for easy review
  - Supports timeframe filtering (e.g., "this week", "last month")
  - Example: `find_missed_sessions("this month")`

### Report Generation Tools

Tools for tracking report creation and distribution:

- **check_report_status**
  - Checks if reports have been generated for a patient
  - Can filter by report type (e.g., "parent summary", "school feedback")
  - Shows report metadata including generation date and recipient
  - Example: `check_report_status("Jane Doe", "progress report")`

### Budget Tracking Tools

These tools help clinicians manage patient budgets and financial planning:

- **check_budget_status**
  - Provides detailed budget information for a patient
  - Shows remaining funds, expiration dates, and usage percentages
  - Identifies session allocations and remaining sessions
  - Example: `check_budget_status("Michael Johnson")`

- **find_low_budget_patients**
  - Identifies patients with low remaining budget (below a specified percentage)
  - Sorts results by remaining percentage for prioritization
  - Includes expiration dates to highlight urgent cases
  - Example: `find_low_budget_patients("15")` (finds patients with less than 15% budget remaining)

### Patient Activity Tools

Tools for monitoring patient engagement:

- **find_inactive_patients**
  - Locates patients who haven't had sessions in a specified time period
  - Shows last session date and days of inactivity
  - Helps identify patients who may need follow-up
  - Example: `find_inactive_patients("45")` (finds patients inactive for 45+ days)

## Implementation Details

All tools follow a consistent pattern:

1. Parse input parameters and handle defaults
2. Query the database using Drizzle ORM
3. Process and format the results for human readability
4. Include error handling for robustness

The tools are implemented as DynamicTool instances in the ReactAgentService and are made available to the LangChain ZeroShotAgent.

## Usage Examples

### Finding Patients with Low Budget

```
Question: Which patients are running low on budget?
Thought: I should use the find_low_budget_patients tool to identify patients with low remaining budget.
Action: find_low_budget_patients
Action Input: 20
Observation: Patients with less than 20% budget remaining:

Patient: Sarah Johnson
Remaining: $245.50 (18.2%)
Total Budget: $1350.00
Expiration Date: 12/31/2023

Patient: Robert Williams
Remaining: $120.75 (8.1%)
Total Budget: $1500.00
Expiration Date: 11/30/2023
```

### Checking Session History

```
Question: How many sessions has John Smith had this month?
Thought: I should use the get_patient_sessions tool to retrieve John's session information.
Action: get_patient_sessions
Action Input: John Smith, this month
Observation: Session information for patient (filtered by "this month"):

Monthly Session Count:
2023-11: 3 sessions

Total Sessions: 3

Recent Sessions:
Date: 11/15/2023
Title: Weekly Check-in
Duration: 45 minutes
Status: completed
Notes: John showed good progress with communication exercises...
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future tool expansion:

1. Predictive analytics tools to forecast patient progress
2. Automated report generation tools
3. Integration with external calendaring systems
4. Enhanced visualization capabilities for budget and goal tracking
