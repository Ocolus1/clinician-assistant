# Frontend Schema Update Summary

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the frontend schema updates completed so far to align with the backend schema changes, where "client" has been renamed to "patient" and "ally" has been renamed to "caregiver".

## Completed Updates

### Service Files

We've updated the following service files to use the new terminology and API endpoints:

1. `budgetUtilizationService.ts` - Updated terminology from "client" to "patient" and API endpoints
2. `progressDataService.ts` - Updated terminology and endpoints, added backward compatibility methods
3. `strategyDataService.ts` - Updated terminology and endpoints, added backward compatibility methods
4. `goalPerformanceService.ts` - Updated API endpoints to use patient terminology
5. `knowledgeService.ts` - Updated terminology throughout, fixed type issues
6. `budgetDataService.simplified.ts` - Updated terminology and endpoints, added backward compatibility methods
7. Created `patientReports.ts` from `clientReports.ts` with updated terminology and backward compatibility functions

### Component Files

We've created the following new components with updated terminology:

1. `PatientCaregivers.tsx` from `ClientAllies.tsx`
2. `PatientGoals.tsx` from `ClientGoals.tsx`
3. `PatientPersonalInfo.tsx` from `ClientPersonalInfo.tsx`
4. `PatientGoalsForm.tsx` from `GoalsForm.tsx`
5. `PatientProfile.tsx` from `ClientProfile.tsx`
6. `PatientSessions.tsx` from `ClientSessions.tsx`
7. `PatientReports.tsx` from `ClientReports.tsx`
8. `PatientBudgetTab.tsx` from `ClientBudgetTab.tsx`
9. `PatientBudget.tsx` from `ClientBudget.tsx`
10. `PatientList.tsx` from `ClientList.tsx`
11. `PatientForm.tsx` from `ClientForm.tsx`
12. `PatientServiceComparison.tsx` from `ClientServiceComparison.tsx`

### Type Definitions

We've updated type definitions to use the new schema names:

1. Renamed `ClientGoal` to `PatientGoal`
2. Renamed `clientId` fields to `patientId`
3. Renamed `allies` to `caregivers` in report interfaces
4. Updated `ClientReportData` to `PatientReportData` in report interfaces
5. Added type aliases for backward compatibility

## Next Steps

1. **Update Routes and Navigation**:
   - Update route definitions that use "client" in the path
   - Update navigation components that reference "client" or "ally"

2. **Update Forms**:
   - Update form field names to match the new schema
   - Update form validation logic to use the new field names

3. **Testing**:
   - Create a comprehensive testing plan
   - Test all updated components and services
   - Verify backward compatibility functions work correctly

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update user documentation to reflect the new terminology
   - Update API documentation to reflect the new endpoints

5. **Deprecation Plan**:
   - Create a plan for removing backward compatibility functions in the future
   - Set timeline for deprecating old components and services

## Implementation Approach

Our implementation approach has focused on:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: All updated services include backward compatibility functions to ensure a smooth transition.
2. **Consistent Terminology**: We've updated all references from "client" to "patient" and "ally" to "caregiver" in the components.
3. **API Endpoint Updates**: We've updated all API endpoint references from `/api/clients/` to `/api/patients/`.
4. **Progressive Implementation**: We're creating new components rather than modifying existing ones to allow for a phased rollout.

## Conclusion

The frontend schema update is progressing well. We've completed the majority of the service and component updates. The next phase will focus on updating routes, navigation, and forms, followed by comprehensive testing to ensure everything works correctly.
