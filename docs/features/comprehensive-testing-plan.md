# Comprehensive Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing plan for verifying the application's functionality after completing the patient/caregiver terminology transition. This includes testing after removing the backward compatibility layer and cleaning up all remaining references to the old terminology.

## Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Unit Testing

#### Service Tests

- **Patient Services**
  - Test all patient-related service functions
  - Verify that data is correctly fetched, created, updated, and deleted
  - Ensure all functions use the new terminology

- **Caregiver Services**
  - Test all caregiver-related service functions
  - Verify that data is correctly fetched, created, updated, and deleted
  - Ensure all functions use the new terminology

- **Budget Services**
  - Test budget calculation functions
  - Verify that budget utilization is correctly calculated
  - Ensure all functions use the new terminology

- **Goal Services**
  - Test goal and subgoal-related functions
  - Verify that goal performance is correctly calculated
  - Ensure all functions use the new terminology

#### Component Tests

- **Patient Components**
  - Test rendering of patient-related components
  - Verify that data is displayed correctly
  - Ensure all components use the new terminology

- **Caregiver Components**
  - Test rendering of caregiver-related components
  - Verify that data is displayed correctly
  - Ensure all components use the new terminology

- **Form Components**
  - Test form validation and submission
  - Verify that data is correctly submitted to the API
  - Ensure all forms use the new terminology

### Phase 2: Integration Testing

#### Patient Management Flow

- **Patient Creation**
  - Create a new patient
  - Verify that the patient is correctly saved
  - Verify that the patient appears in the patient list

- **Patient Update**
  - Update an existing patient
  - Verify that the changes are correctly saved
  - Verify that the updated information appears in the UI

- **Patient Profile**
  - Navigate to a patient's profile
  - Verify that all patient information is correctly displayed
  - Verify that all tabs (personal, caregivers, goals, budget, sessions, reports) work correctly

#### Caregiver Management Flow

- **Caregiver Creation**
  - Add a new caregiver to a patient
  - Verify that the caregiver is correctly saved
  - Verify that the caregiver appears in the patient's profile

- **Caregiver Update**
  - Update an existing caregiver
  - Verify that the changes are correctly saved
  - Verify that the updated information appears in the UI

#### Budget Management Flow

- **Budget Settings**
  - Create or update budget settings
  - Verify that the settings are correctly saved
  - Verify that the settings appear in the budget view

- **Budget Items**
  - Add, update, and delete budget items
  - Verify that the changes are correctly saved
  - Verify that the budget calculations are correct

#### Goals Management Flow

- **Goal Creation**
  - Create a new goal for a patient
  - Verify that the goal is correctly saved
  - Verify that the goal appears in the patient's profile

- **Subgoal Management**
  - Add, update, and delete subgoals
  - Verify that the changes are correctly saved
  - Verify that the subgoals appear under the correct goal

### Phase 3: End-to-End Testing

#### Complete User Journeys

- **New Patient Onboarding**
  - Create a new patient
  - Add caregivers
  - Set up goals
  - Configure budget settings
  - Add budget items
  - Verify that all data is correctly saved and displayed

- **Session Management**
  - Create a new session for a patient
  - Add notes and assessments
  - Verify that the session is correctly saved
  - Verify that the session appears in the patient's profile

- **Reporting**
  - Generate reports for a patient
  - Verify that the reports contain correct data
  - Verify that all terminology in the reports is consistent

### Phase 4: Performance and Edge Case Testing

#### Performance Testing

- **Large Data Sets**
  - Test with a large number of patients
  - Test with a large number of caregivers
  - Test with a large number of goals and subgoals
  - Verify that the application remains responsive

#### Edge Case Testing

- **Empty Data**
  - Test with patients that have no caregivers
  - Test with patients that have no goals
  - Test with patients that have no budget items
  - Verify that the UI handles these cases gracefully

- **Invalid Data**
  - Test with invalid input data
  - Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed
  - Verify that the application does not crash

### Phase 5: Browser and Device Testing

#### Browser Compatibility

- Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Verify that all functionality works correctly on all browsers
- Verify that the UI is consistent across browsers

#### Device Compatibility

- Test on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Verify that the UI is responsive and usable on all devices
- Verify that all functionality works correctly on all devices

## Test Documentation

For each test, document the following:

- Test name and description
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected result
- Actual result
- Pass/Fail status
- Any issues or observations

## Issue Tracking

For any issues found during testing:

1. Document the issue with steps to reproduce
2. Assign a severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. Create a ticket in the issue tracking system
4. Prioritize fixes based on severity

## Timeline

- Day 1-2: Unit and component testing
- Day 3-4: Integration testing
- Day 5: End-to-end testing
- Day 6: Performance and edge case testing
- Day 7: Browser and device testing
- Day 8: Issue resolution and regression testing
- Day 9-10: Final verification and sign-off

## Deliverables

- Completed test documentation
- List of issues found and their resolution
- Final test report with pass/fail status for all test cases
- Sign-off document confirming that the application is ready for release
