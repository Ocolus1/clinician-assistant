## Remaining Tasks

1. **Update Additional Components**:
   - [x] Review and update any remaining components that use "client" or "ally" terminology
   - [x] Update any imports in other files that reference the old component names

2. **Update Routes and Navigation**:
   - [x] Update route definitions that use "client" in the path
   - [x] Update navigation components that reference "client" or "ally"

3. **Update Forms**:
   - [x] Update form field names to match the new schema
   - [x] Update form validation logic to use the new field names

4. **Testing**:
   - [x] Create a comprehensive testing plan
   - [x] Execute Phase 1: Unit Tests (April 29, 2025)
   - [ ] Execute Phase 2: Integration Tests (May 1-2, 2025)
   - [ ] Execute Phase 3: Backward Compatibility Tests (May 3, 2025)
   - [ ] Execute Phase 4: Browser and Device Testing (May 4-5, 2025)

## Testing Implementation

- [x] Create a comprehensive testing plan
  - Created detailed testing implementation document with unit tests, integration tests, and backward compatibility tests
  - Defined test execution timeline from April 29 to May 5, 2025

- [x] Execute Phase 1: Unit Tests (April 29, 2025)
  - Set up Jest and React Testing Library testing environment
  - Implemented unit tests for services:
    - `budgetUtilizationService` tests passing
  - Implemented component tests:
    - `PatientReports` component tests
    - `CaregiverForm` component tests
  - Implemented integration tests:
    - Patient-Caregiver flow tests
  - Implemented backward compatibility tests:
    - Client-Patient API compatibility tests (passing)
    - Ally-Caregiver API compatibility tests (passing)
    - Legacy schema mapping tests (passing)
  - Implemented backward compatibility layer:
    - Created `apiCompatibility.ts` utility with functions for mapping legacy API paths and data schemas
    - Updated `queryClient.ts` to use the compatibility utilities for all API requests
    - Successfully tested backward compatibility for client/patient and ally/caregiver terminology

- [ ] Execute Phase 2: Integration Tests (May 1-2, 2025)
- [ ] Execute Phase 3: Backward Compatibility Tests (May 3, 2025)
- [ ] Execute Phase 4: Browser and Device Testing (May 4-5, 2025)

## Notes and Considerations

- All updated components and services include backward compatibility to ensure a smooth transition.
- The type definitions have been updated to use the new schema names, with type aliases for backward compatibility.
- API endpoint references have been updated from `/api/clients/` to `/api/patients/`.
- All references from "ally" to "caregiver" and "client" to "patient" have been updated in the components.
- Created EnhancedPatientList.tsx component to replace EnhancedClientList.tsx with updated terminology.
- Updated App.tsx to use the new component names and route paths.
- Created CaregiverForm.tsx component to replace AllyForm.tsx with updated terminology and API endpoints.
- Form validation now uses insertCaregiverSchema instead of insertAllySchema.
- Created a detailed testing implementation document in `frontend-schema-update-testing-implementation.md` with specific test examples and execution plan.
