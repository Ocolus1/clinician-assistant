# Schema Migration Status

## Overview

This document provides information about the current status of the schema migration process, including what has been completed, what is pending, and explanations for specific issues encountered.

## Schema Changes

### Table Renames

The following tables have been renamed for better AI interpretability:

| Old Table Name | New Table Name |
|----------------|----------------|
| clients | patients |
| allies | caregivers |
| client_clinicians | patient_clinicians |
| performance_assessments | goal_assessments |

### Column Renames

The following columns have been renamed across various tables:

| Old Column Name | New Column Name |
|-----------------|----------------|
| client_id | patient_id |
| ally_id | caregiver_id |
| priority | importance_level (in goals table) |

## Current Status

### Code Changes

✅ Updated TypeScript interfaces and implementations
✅ Fixed TypeScript errors in the backend
✅ Updated API endpoints to use the new schema names
✅ Created scripts to automate the migration process
✅ Fixed foreign key relationships in milestone_assessments table

### Database Changes

⚠️ **Pending**: The actual database schema changes have not been applied yet because:
1. The DATABASE_URL environment variable needs to be set
2. The migration scripts need to be run with proper database credentials

### Data Migration

⚠️ **Pending**: Data migration from old tables to new tables has not been completed yet.

## Specific Issues

### Performance Assessments Table

The `performance_assessments` table doesn't exist anymore because it has been renamed to `goal_assessments` as part of our schema migration. This was a deliberate change to better reflect the purpose of these assessments in relation to goals.

In the code, all references to performance assessments have been updated to use goal assessments:
- Method names in the storage interface and implementation
- API endpoints and route handlers
- TypeScript types and interfaces
- Foreign key relationships in the milestone_assessments table

### Empty Goals Table

The goals table is currently empty because:

1. The database schema migration has not been run yet
2. Data from the old schema has not been migrated to the new schema

Once we run the migration scripts with the proper database connection, the data will be transferred to the new tables, including the goals table.

## Next Steps

1. Set the DATABASE_URL environment variable
2. Run the schema migration script (`run-migration.cjs`)
3. Run the data migration script (`data-migration.cjs`)
4. Verify the database structure and data using the check script (`check-database-tables.cjs`)
5. Test the API endpoints to ensure they work with the new schema

## Conclusion

The schema migration is well underway with all code changes completed. The remaining steps involve executing the database migration scripts and verifying that the data has been properly transferred to the new schema.
