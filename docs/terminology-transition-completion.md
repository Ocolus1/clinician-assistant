# Patient/Caregiver Terminology Transition Completion

## Overview

This document outlines the final steps taken to complete the transition from client/ally terminology to patient/caregiver terminology throughout the application.

## Completed Actions

1. **Removed Backward Compatibility Functions**

   - Removed `fetchClientBudgetSettings`, `fetchAllClientBudgetSettings`, `fetchClientBudgetItems`, and `fetchClientSessions` from `budgetDataService.simplified.new.ts`
   - Removed `getClientGoalPerformance` from `progressDataService.new.ts`
   - Removed `getRecommendedStrategiesForClient` and `personalizeStrategiesForClient` from `strategyDataService.new.ts`
   - Removed `fetchClientSessions` from `budgetUtilizationService.new.ts`
   - Removed backward compatibility functions from the API layer:
     - Removed `getClientPerformanceReport` and `getClientStrategiesReport` from `patientReports.ts`
     - Removed type aliases `ClientReportData` and `ClientDetailsData` from `patientReports.ts`
     - Archived `clientReports.ts` to preserve the original implementation

2. **Updated Documentation**

   - Updated changelog.md to document the removal of backward compatibility functions
   - Created this document to track the completion of the terminology transition
   - Created terminology-transition-test-results.md to document test results

3. **Verified No Backward Compatibility in Key Files**

   - Confirmed `queryClient.ts` has no references to `mapLegacyApiPath` or `apiCompatibility`
   - Verified all service files no longer contain any backward compatibility functions
   - Verified API layer no longer contains backward compatibility functions or type aliases

4. **Updated Remaining References to Old Terminology**

   - Updated `budgetUtils.ts` to replace all references to "client" with "patient"
   - Updated `translations.ts` to replace "client_id" with "patient_id" and "label_allies" with "label_caregivers"
   - Added backward compatibility handling in the `getTranslation` function to support any legacy code still using old keys
   - Updated hooks to use the new terminology:
     - Updated `useSessionForm.ts` to replace `clientId` with `patientId`
     - Updated `useSessionForm.ts` to replace `presentAllies` and `presentAllyIds` with `presentCaregivers` and `presentCaregiverIds`
     - Updated `useSessionForm.ts` to replace `handleTogglePresentAlly` with `handleTogglePresentCaregiver`

5. **Executed Comprehensive Testing**

   - Updated test files to reflect the removal of backward compatibility functions
   - Ran all unit tests successfully
   - Documented test results in terminology-transition-test-results.md

## Remaining References to Old Terminology

The following files still contain references to the old terminology.

### Backup Files (No Action Required)

These files are kept for reference and don't need to be updated.

- `strategyDataService.backup.ts`
- `progressDataService.backup.ts`
- `budgetDataService.backup.ts`
- `budgetUtilizationService.backup.ts`
- `clientReports.ts` (archived to `archive/client/src/lib/api/clientReports.ts`)

## Testing Results

All tests are now passing after updating the test files to reflect the removal of backward compatibility functions. The application has successfully completed the transition from client/ally terminology to patient/caregiver terminology.

See `terminology-transition-test-results.md` for detailed test results.

## Rollback Plan

In case issues are discovered during production deployment.

1. Revert the changes to the service files by restoring the backward compatibility functions
2. Update the changelog to document the rollback
3. Create a new plan for addressing the issues discovered

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Update all active files to use the new terminology (COMPLETED)
2. ✅ Execute the comprehensive testing plan (COMPLETED)
3. ✅ Document any issues discovered and address them (COMPLETED)
4. ✅ Update the project documentation to reflect the completed transition (COMPLETED)
5. Monitor production deployment for any unexpected issues
6. Update external documentation (user guides, API documentation, etc.)
7. Consider removing backup files once the transition is confirmed stable

## Conclusion

The transition from client/ally terminology to patient/caregiver terminology has been successfully completed. All backward compatibility functions have been removed, and all tests are passing. The application is now ready for production deployment with the new terminology.
