# ReactAgentService Optimization Plan

## Current Status
- Patient Info queries: 100% success rate
- Flexible Query Builder queries: 0% success rate (hitting max iterations)
- Overall success rate: 50%

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Specialized Query Tools
Create dedicated tools for common query patterns to reduce reliance on the flexible query builder:
- `get_patient_goals_tool`: Specifically for retrieving goals for a patient
- `get_patient_sessions_tool`: Specifically for retrieving sessions for a patient
- `get_patient_budget_tool`: Specifically for retrieving budget information for a patient

### 2. Flexible Query Builder Improvements
- Further simplify the response format to reduce token usage
- Implement query templates for common query patterns
- Add caching for frequently used queries
- Implement pagination for large result sets

### 3. Agent Configuration Improvements
- Further increase maxIterations for complex queries (consider 20-25)
- Implement a fallback mechanism for queries that hit the max iterations limit
- Add more specific examples in the agent prompt
- Consider using a structured output parser for the agent

### 4. Testing and Monitoring
- Expand test suite to cover more query patterns
- Add logging for query execution time and token usage
- Implement automated performance testing
- Create a dashboard for monitoring agent performance

## Implementation Priority
1. Create specialized tools for the most common query patterns
2. Optimize the flexible query builder response format
3. Adjust agent configuration parameters
4. Expand test coverage
5. Implement monitoring and logging

## Success Criteria
- Flexible Query Builder queries: >80% success rate
- Overall success rate: >90%
- Average query response time: <3 seconds
- No max iterations errors for common query patterns
