# ReactAgentService Changelog Update (2025-05-02)

## Implemented Code Splitting and Optimized ReactAgentService

### Changes Made
- Implemented code splitting to improve maintainability and reduce complexity
- Created a separate module for the flexible query builder tool
- Simplified the ReactAgentService to focus on core functionality
- Created a backup of the original ReactAgentService for reference
- Fixed TypeScript errors related to null values in Date constructor
- Added proper type annotations for query builders
- Increased maxIterations from 8 to 15 to handle more complex queries
- Optimized the flexible query builder for better performance
- Simplified the agent prompt to be more concise and provide clearer examples

### Test Results
- Patient Info Queries: 100% success rate
- Flexible Query Builder Queries: 0% success rate (still hitting max iterations)
- Overall Success Rate: 50% across all tested categories

### Technical Details
- Created a new directory structure for tools: `server/services/tools/`
- Moved the flexible query builder to its own file: `queryBuilderTool.ts`
- Added proper error handling with specific error messages
- Implemented a simplified version of the ReactAgentService
- Created a backup of the original implementation for reference
- Created a new test script `agent_category_test.js` to evaluate performance across different query categories
- Optimized the flexible query builder to provide more concise and structured responses

### Next Steps
- Further optimize the flexible query builder to prevent max iterations errors
- Consider implementing a more specialized tool for common query patterns
- Explore alternative approaches for complex queries, such as using predefined query templates
- Continue testing and optimizing the agent's performance
- Add more specialized tools for common query patterns
- Gradually migrate other tools to the new modular structure
