Financial Tab Redesign: Budget Item Utilization Dashboard
After analyzing the current financial tab design and understanding the critical connection to the active budget plan in the client profile, here's a revised approach focused on tracking individual budget items and their utilization:

Conceptual Redesign: "Budget Item Utilization Dashboard"
1. Budget Items Utilization Grid
Main Component: A sortable, filterable grid showing:
Each individual budget item from the active plan
Allocated quantity/amount for each item
Used quantity/amount to date
Remaining quantity/amount
Utilization percentage with visual indicator
Price per unit
Total allocated cost vs. used cost
Days remaining until plan expiration
2. Visual Item Consumption Chart
Stacked Bar Chart: Showing:
Each budget item represented as a segment
Used portions in solid color
Remaining portions in lighter shade/pattern
Items sorted by percentage utilized (highest to lowest)
Option to sort by category, cost, or alphabetically
3. Usage Pace Indicators
For Each Budget Item:
Small trend arrow showing if usage is on track, too fast, or too slow
Visual meter showing ideal usage rate vs. actual usage rate
Weeks/months of supply remaining at current usage rate
Items at risk of under/overutilization highlighted
4. Plan Overview Card
Comprehensive Plan Status:
Active plan name and code
Plan dates (start and expiration) with days remaining
Total budget amount allocated
Total amount spent to date
Percentage of plan utilized
Graphical timeline showing current position in plan period
5. Utilization Forecast
Projection Visualization:
Line chart showing projected utilization of each major item
Intersection point showing when items will be depleted
Critical dates flagged where items may run out before plan end
Option to adjust usage intensity to see impact on forecast
6. Budget Reallocation Suggestions
Smart Recommendations:
Items with excessive allocation identified
Items at risk of running out highlighted
Suggested reallocation amounts from underused to overused items
Estimated impact of reallocation on overall plan optimization
7. Usage History
Time-Series Visualization:
Monthly usage of each item shown as a small multiple
Pattern identification (steady, increasing, seasonal)
Comparison to similar clients' usage patterns (anonymized)
Drill-down capability for detailed session-by-session usage
8. Service Gap Analysis
Needs Assessment:
Identifying budget items with zero or minimal usage
Suggestion for items that might benefit the client based on their profile
Comparison with therapy goals to ensure alignment
Alert for underutilized therapy categories
Visual Design Principles
Item-Centric Design:

Each budget item has consistent visual representation across all views
Color coding by category for easy pattern recognition
Clear numerical presentation of quantities remaining
Prominent display of "days remaining" to create urgency when appropriate
Progressive Disclosure:

Summary view shows critical items and overall plan status
Drill-down capability for detailed item analysis
Expandable sections for deeper metrics
Tooltip details on hover for additional context
Action-Oriented Layout:

Most at-risk items prominently displayed
Quick-filter buttons for "Overused", "Underused", "On Track"
Prioritized recommendations at top of view
Export and share capabilities for client discussions
Key Features
Toggle between quantity view (units) and financial view (dollars)
Filter by therapy category or service type
Compare across multiple active plans if applicable
Historical view option showing previous plans' utilization patterns
Real-time updates when new sessions are added
By implementing this redesigned financial tab with a focus on specific budget items from the active plan, clinicians would gain a detailed understanding of exactly which services are being utilized effectively and which may need adjustment. This approach directly addresses the core business challenge of maximizing fund utilization before plan expiration, while providing actionable insights at the individual service level.
