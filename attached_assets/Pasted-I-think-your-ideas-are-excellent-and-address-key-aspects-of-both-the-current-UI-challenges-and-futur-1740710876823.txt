I think your ideas are excellent and address key aspects of both the current UI challenges and future scalability. Let me share my thoughts on each point:

Budget ID/Serial Number
This is an excellent forward-thinking approach. Adding a budget ID/serial number will:

Enable proper version control of budgets
Allow for clear historical tracking when plans expire or extend
Make the transition between active and inactive budgets more manageable
Support future reporting and analysis capabilities
Two-Column Layout with Better Organization
Your proposed structure makes perfect sense:

Left Column: Budget Item Cards

Each budget item displayed as an individual card
Cards could include item code, description, quantity, unit price, and total
Quick edit/delete options for each card
Visual organization by category if applicable
Running subtotal showing allocation against available funds
Right Column: Plan Configuration & Add Items

Budget settings (available funds, end date, plan ID/serial)
Visual fund allocation chart (pie or bar showing distribution)
Prominent "Add Item" button that opens a modal
Summary statistics (used funds, remaining funds, item count)
Items Configuration & Auto-Population
Your suggestion to implement a searchable dropdown with auto-population is very user-friendly:

When selecting an item code, auto-fill description and unit price
This reduces data entry errors and improves consistency
The settings page for managing the item catalog is a great idea for administrators
Additional Implementation Thoughts:
Dynamic Validation: Show real-time updates to available funds as items are added
Category Organization: Allow grouping of budget items by category for better organization
Versioning UI: Include visual indicators for which budget version is active/expired
Modal Design: The "Add Item" modal should be clean and focused with the searchable dropdown being prominent
This approach maintains consistency with your other forms while addressing the specific needs of budget management, which inherently has more complex data relationships than the other sections.

Would you like me to create a more detailed mockup or implementation plan for this approach?
