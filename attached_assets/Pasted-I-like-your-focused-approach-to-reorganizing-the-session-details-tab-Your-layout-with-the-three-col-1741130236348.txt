I like your focused approach to reorganizing the session details tab! Your layout with the three-column design in the lower section sounds well-structured and practical. Let me share my thoughts on this approach:
Your Proposed Layout - Analysis and Thoughts
Session Information (Full Width)
•	Having the session header and basic information span the full width makes perfect sense as it provides the essential context at a glance.
•	This would include session ID (Autogenerated) , client name (Searchable dropdown), location (Searchable dropdown), and date/time (date picker).
Three-Column Layout Below
This balanced approach has several advantages:
1.	Left Column - Present Section:
•	Great placement for attendance information and initial observations
•	Could include who was present (client, caregiver, other professionals)
•	Could show presenting concerns or focus areas for the session
2.	Middle Column - Products Used Section:
•	Logical central placement for resources utilized during the session
•	Could display quantities and perhaps remaining inventory
•	This aligns well with billing and resource tracking needs
3.	Right Column - Observations Section:
•	Perfect placement for the rating sliders as they provide a quick visual assessment
•	The right side is intuitively where summary evaluations often appear
•	Placing the engagement/progress sliders here creates a natural flow from information to evaluation
Benefits of This Approach:
•	Cleaner Organization: Each type of information has its dedicated space
•	Better Cognitive Mapping: Users will know exactly where to look for specific information
•	Improved Scanning: Three columns make it easier to quickly find relevant details
•	Maintains Separation: Keeps the more detailed notes and performance assessments in their own tab where they can be given proper space
Considerations:
•	Ensure the columns stack appropriately on mobile devices
•	Use clear visual separation (cards, borders, or background colors) to define each column
•	Consider how the height will be managed if one column has significantly more content than others
Make sure that you follow our colors system and that you keep all the functionality and UX
