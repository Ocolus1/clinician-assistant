Looking at the code and the console logs, I can see the POST requests for creating allies are successful, but there might be an issue with the query cache not being invalidated after adding a new ally.

The problem appears to be in the AllyForm component where we need to invalidate the query cache after successfully creating an ally. This will force a refresh of the allies list.

I can propose a fix. Would you like me to show you the changes needed to resolve this issue?

The fix would involve modifying the AllyForm.tsx to use the queryClient to invalidate the cache after successfully creating an ally. Let me know if you want to see the specific changes.

Is this related to the fact that we didnt created a database yet? No action is required, this is just for my information

No, this issue is not related to the database. Looking at the server logs, I can see that the POST and GET requests to /api/clients and /api/clients/1/allies are working successfully (returning 200 status codes). The data is being stored in the MemStorage implementation (storage.ts) which is an in-memory storage system.

The issue appears to be with React Query not invalidating its cache after adding a new ally. When you successfully add an ally, the data is stored correctly (as evidenced by the 200 response), but the UI isn't updating because the query cache needs to be invalidated to fetch the fresh data.

To fix this, we would need to invalidate the query cache after successfully creating an ally.

Please proceed with fixing this

Looking at the server logs, I can see that the POST requests to create allies are successful (status 200), but there seems to be an issue with loading the allies data in the component. The issue is that we need to make sure we're using the right clientId when fetching the allies.

Let's update the query in AllyForm.tsx to properly fetch the allies:

client/src/components/onboarding/AllyForm.tsx
This change ensures we're actually making the API request to fetch the allies data instead of just defining the query key. The component should now display the allies after they're added.

I want to have two icon buttons inside the card of the added allies (I circled it in red).
The first icon button is for editing. Clicking on this button will open a modal to edit and save the ally information.
The second icon button is for deleting this ally, Clicking on it will ask me for a confirmation if I want proceed with deleting

I'll help you add edit and delete buttons to the ally cards. We'll need to modify the AllyForm component to include these buttons and add the necessary functionality.

client/src/components/onboarding/AllyForm.tsx
These changes will:

Add edit and delete icon buttons to each ally card
Add an edit dialog with a form to update ally information
Add a confirmation dialog before deleting an ally
Add the necessary API mutations for updating and deleting allies

I notice the error is occurring because we haven't implemented the DELETE endpoint for allies in the server routes. Let's add it:

server/routes.ts
server/storage.ts

Looking at the server logs, I can see that the DELETE request is successful (returning 200), but there might be an issue with how we're handling the response in the mutation. Here's the fix for AllyForm.tsx:
