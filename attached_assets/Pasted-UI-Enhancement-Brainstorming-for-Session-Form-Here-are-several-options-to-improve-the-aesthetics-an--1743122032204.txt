UI Enhancement Brainstorming for Session Form
Here are several options to improve the aesthetics and UI of the session form screen:

Colors & Visual Hierarchy
Brand Color Integration

Apply a subtle brand color to the tab headers and primary buttons
Use color to indicate active/selected state more prominently in the tabs
Add a light color band across the top of the form for visual anchoring
Depth & Elevation

Apply subtle shadows to cards in the summary panel to create hierarchy
Add hover states with elevation changes for interactive elements
Use a subtle gradient background for the header to create depth
Borders & Spacing
Card Refinements

Replace sharp corners with rounded borders (8px radius) for all cards
Add a thin border (1px) with subtle color to cards instead of only shadows
Increase padding within cards (from current p-4 to p-5 or p-6)
Consistent Spacing

Standardize vertical spacing between sections (20px or 24px consistently)
Increase margin between form fields for better visual separation
Add subtle dividers between related form groups
Typography & Text Hierarchy
Font Styling Improvements

Increase font size differentiation between headers and content
Use a semi-bold weight for section headers instead of medium
Add subtle text color variations for labels vs. values
Information Grouping

Apply background colors to group related information
Use typography to better distinguish between form labels and values
Add subtle text color variations (not just gray) for secondary information
Iconography & Visual Elements
Enhanced Icon Usage

Add relevant icons next to section headings (calendar icon near Date & Time)
Use colored icons for status indicators (green check for completed sections)
Replace text-only buttons with icon+text combinations for better scanning
Interactive Elements

Add subtle hover animations for buttons and interactive elements
Use icon animation for state changes (expanding/collapsing sections)
Implement micro-interactions for common actions (selecting fields, adding items)
Layout & Alignment
Field Presentation

Convert stacked form fields to more space-efficient inline groups
Align labels and inputs consistently (all left-aligned or right-aligned labels)
Use grid layout for form fields with consistent column widths
Summary Panel Enhancements

Add visual indicators for empty states (icons for "no products")
Implement collapsible sections in the summary panel
Add more visual distinction between summary card sections
