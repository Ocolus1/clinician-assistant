I understand you'd like to implement most of the UI enhancements I suggested, but want to avoid the issues we faced previously. Let's create a staged implementation plan that will help us make gradual improvements without getting stuck.

Staged Implementation Plan for Session Form UI Enhancements
Stage 1: Basic Visual Structure Improvements
Focus: Layout and basic styling without changing functionality

Card-based layout - Add subtle shadows and borders to section groups
Section headers - Add simple headers with icons
Spacing and alignment - Improve the spacing between elements
This stage focuses on simple CSS/styling changes that are unlikely to break functionality and will establish the foundation for future enhancements.

Stage 2: Icon Integration and Static Visual Elements
Focus: Adding visual elements that don't affect data flow

Field icons - Add icons next to field labels (client, location, etc.)
Visual indicators - Add simple status indicators and badges
Better styled selectors - Enhance the appearance of dropdowns and inputs
Since this stage only adds visual elements without changing functionality, it's low risk but improves usability.

Stage 3: Attendee Section Enhancement
Focus: Improving the attendee section

Role indicators - Add simple role badges for attendees
Avatar placeholders - Add basic avatar support
Visual grouping - Better visual organization of attendees
This focuses on a single section to avoid widespread changes at once.

Stage 4: Product Section Enhancement
Focus: Improving the product selection experience

Visual product cards - Replace text listings with card-based design
Improved quantity selector - Better quantity control interface
Availability indicators - Visual feedback for product availability
Like Stage 3, this focuses on improving a single section.

Stage 5: Enhanced Interactive Elements
Focus: Improving the interactive experience

Tooltips - Add information tooltips for fields
Improved date/time picker - Enhanced calendar component
Validation feedback - Better error/validation message styling
This stage adds more complex interactive elements but builds on the stable foundation from previous stages.

Stage 6: Advanced Features and Animations
Focus: Adding polish and advanced features

Progress indicator - Add progress tracking between tabs
Simple animations - Add subtle animations for adding/removing items
Loading states - Improve visual feedback during data operations
This final stage adds the most complex elements that might affect functionality.

Implementation Strategy:
Complete one stage at a time
Test thoroughly after each stage
Consider creating a branch for each stage implementation
Start with the simplest changes first
Review previous issues and avoid similar patterns
